# NumberToSpeech
Turns numerical input into text and speech 

This is a short program where the user inputs a numerical value and the program will print the number in text as well as create an .mp3 file with audio. 

I used Google Text-To-Speech for this 

I haven't finished yet. 

Still do to: 
- allow user in input a float 
- fix gramatical errors in some number ( 1001 = one thousand and one, 1001 != one thousand one) 
- create a GUI
